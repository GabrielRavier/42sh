FILE subsystem
Reach 100% coverage in tests
faster memchr
faster memmem (that passes tests lol)
assembly memset
search.h
bsearch
getopt - Beyond POSIX compliance (next tests should be kernels/MidnightBSD/contrib/diff/gnulib-tests/test-getopt.h) (requires FILE subsystem)
make full proper printf that handles floating point stuff and uses some kind of FILE subsystem (try to avoid malloc too if possible)

Search in historical stuff - After PDP7
Better performance for my_getenv: Then increase NUM_VARS in setenv tests back to 8192
Search in historical stuff - Start with Research-PDP7
Do putc right after FILE subsystem base (buffer flush function (_flsbuf))
Do putw right after fwrite/putc

Clean up any usage of system functions (such as `malloc`) and replace them with configurable `my_FUNC` (for "FUNC" a function like malloc) equivalents that can be disabled when needed
